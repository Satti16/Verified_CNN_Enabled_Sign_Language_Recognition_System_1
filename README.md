# Verified_CNN_Enabled_Sign_Language_Recognition_System_1
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize hand gestures for sign language. It captures images via webcam, processes them with deep learning, and translates signs into text, enabling communication for hearing-impaired individuals.
